It has been over 11 years since that point, and it all started at the Menlo Circus Club. I took a liking to the sport since it felt so fast paced while also being so independent. 
                                Talking about my family, my dad immigrated from India at the age of 5 and my mom has always lived in the United States. I've taken part in many of my dad's traditions, usually attending Indian weddings with his family mainly in the east coast.

                                be joining our school's varisty roster and keep our trend of being part of the top in the nation.
